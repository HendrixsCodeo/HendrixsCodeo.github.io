                  <h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
                     <p>Net Neutrality rules is the basic principle that declines Huge ISP providers (Internet Service Providers) like Comcast, at&#x26t, verizon, &#x26 charter from blocking content, slowing down, or speeding up any content website or apps you use.</p>
              <h3>Why is it Important</h3>
              <p>Net Neutrality gives us freedom on the internet and without these rules ISP providers can increase wifi speeds, add additional fee's to websites, slow down speeds, or even block entire websites. It is important to keep these rules because it takes away the whole purpose of the internet and paying small fee's not getting high speeds and minutes just to go to a site like youtube will make it very weird. </p>
