           <p>I am skilled in Typing, Gaming, Coding, and Playing Sports. I have developed 2 of the skills (Typing, and Gaming) from a fairly early age and Coding and Sports I just barely got into 3-4 years ago.</p>
           <h2>Hobbies</h2>
           <p>One of my hobbies is just playing catch with my brother and sister since we have nothing to do 24/7 so we just go outside and catch. My 2nd Hobby is gaming because I really like gaming and it's fairly addicting. My last hobby is sleeping because I'm lazy and I have nothing else better to do.</p>
           <h2>Interests</h2>
           <p>I have 3 interests My first is gaming because gaming has been apart of my life since I was 6 so i'm pretty fond of gaming with friends & family. My 2nd interest are computers because just like gaming it's been apart of my life for a long time. The first game I played was roblox (2007). My last and favorite interest are watching movies because watching a good movie is a great way to kill time and spend time with friends or family.</p>
